  abstract = {Daily tasks rely on our ability to generate multi-dimensional shoulder torques. When function is limited, strength assessments are used to identify impairments and guide treatment. However, these assessments are often one-dimensional and limited in their sensitivity to diagnose shoulder pathology. To address these limitations, we have proposed novel metrics to quantify shoulder torque capacity in all directions. To quantify the feasible torque space of the shoulder, we measured maximal volitional shoulder torques in 32 unique directions and fit an ellipsoid model to these data. This ellipsoid model was used to quantify overall strength magnitude, strength balance, and the directions in which participants were strongest and weakest. We used these metrics to characterize three-dimensional shoulder strength in healthy adults and demonstrated their repeatability across days. Finally, using musculoskeletal simulations, we showed that our proposed metrics can distinguish between changes in muscle strength associated with aging or rotator cuff tears and quantified the influence of altered experimental conditions on this diagnostic capacity. Our results demonstrate that the proposed metrics can robustly quantify the feasible torque space of the shoulder and may provide a clinically useful description of the functional capacity of the shoulder in health and disease.},

  abstract = {Shoulder strength is reduced in older adults but has only been assessed in planar motions that do not reflect the diverse requirements of daily tasks. We quantified the impact of age on strength spanning the three degrees of freedom relevant to shoulder function, referred to as the feasible torque space. We hypothesized that the feasible torque space would differ with age and expected this age-effect to reflect direction-specific deficits. We measured strength in 32 directions to characterize the feasible torque space of the shoulder in participants without shoulder pain or tendinous pathology (n\,=\,39, 19--86\,years). We modeled the feasible torque space for each participant as an ellipsoid, computed the ellipsoid size and direction-specific metrics (ellipsoid position, orientation, and shape), and then tested the effect of age on each metric. Age was negatively associated with ellipsoid size (a measure of overall strength magnitude; -0.0033\,{\textpm}\,0.0007 (Nm/kg)/year, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001). Contrary to our expectation, the effect of age on the direction-specific metrics did not reach statistical significance. The effect of age did not differ significantly between male and female participants. Three-dimensional strength measurements allowed us to constrain the direction of participants' maximum torque production and characterize the entire feasible torque space. Our findings support a generalized shoulder strengthening program to address age-related shoulder weakness in those without pain or pathology. Clinical exam findings of imbalanced weakness may suggest underlying pathology beyond an effect of age. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine the positive or negative impact of our results.},

  abstract = {The robustness of motor outputs to muscle dysfunction has been investigated using musculoskeletal modeling, but with conflicting results owing to differences in model complexity and motor tasks. Our objective was to systematically study how the number of kinematic degrees of freedom, and the number of independent muscle actuators alter the robustness of motor output to muscle dysfunction. We took a detailed musculoskeletal model of the human leg and systematically varied the model complexity to create six models with either 3 or 7 kinematic degrees of freedom and either 14, 26, or 43 muscle actuators. We tested the redundancy of each model by quantifying the reduction in sagittal plane feasible force set area when a single muscle was removed. The robustness of feasible force set area to the loss of any single muscle, i.e. general single muscle loss increased with the number of independent muscles and decreased with the number of kinematic degrees of freedom, with the robust area varying from 1\% and 52\% of the intact feasible force set area. The maximum sensitivity of the feasible force set to the loss of any single muscle varied from 75\% to 26\% of the intact feasible force set area as the number of muscles increased. Additionally, the ranges of feasible muscle activation for maximum force production were largely unconstrained in many cases, indicating ample musculoskeletal redundancy even for maximal forces. We propose that ratio of muscles to kinematic degrees of freedom can be used as a rule of thumb for estimating musculoskeletal redundancy in both simulated and real biomechanical systems.},

This article presents a practical convex hull algorithm that combines the two-dimensional Quickhull algorithm with the general-dimension Beneath-Beyond Algorithm. It is similar to the randomized, incremental algorithms for convex hull and delaunay triangulation. We provide empirical evidence that the algorithm runs faster when the input contains nonextreme points and that it used less memory. computational geometry algorithms have traditionally assumed that input sets are well behaved. When an algorithm is implemented with floating-point arithmetic, this assumption can lead to serous errors. We briefly describe a solution to this problem when computing the convex hull in two, three, or four dimensions. The output is a set of ``thick'' facets that contain all possible exact convex hulls of the input. A variation is effective in five or more dimensions.},

Soft pneumatic actuators, a prevalent type of soft robot, are the focus of this paper. A new geometrical parameter for soft artificial pneumatic muscles is introduced, enabling the prediction of actuation behavior using analytical models based on specific design parameters. The study investigated the impact of the chamber pitch parameter and actuation conditions on the deformation direction and internal stress of three tested soft pneumatic muscle (SPM) models. Simulation involved the modeling of hyperelastic materials using finite element analysis. Additionally, an artificial neural network (ANN) was employed to predict pressure values in three chambers at desired Cartesian positions. The trained ANN model demonstrated exceptional performance. It achieved high accuracy with training, validation, and testing residuals of 99.58\%, 99.89\%, and 99.79\%, respectively. During the validation simulations and neural network results, the maximum errors in the x, y, and z coordinates were found to be 9.3\%, 7.83\%, and 8.8\%, respectively. These results highlight the successful performance and efficacy of the trained ANN model in accurately predicting pressure values for the desired positions in the soft pneumatic muscles.},

  abstract = {Pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) are one of the key technologies in soft robotics, and they enable actuation in mobile robots, in wearable devices and exoskeletons for assistive and rehabilitative purposes. While they recently showed relevant improvements, they still present quite low payload, limited bandwidth, and lack of repeatability, controllability and robustness. Vacuum-based actuation has been recently demonstrated as a very promising solution, and many challenges are still open, like generating at the same time a large contraction ratio, and a high blocking force with enhanced axial stiffness. In this paper, a novel Ultralight Hybrid PAM (UH-PAM), based on bellow-type elastomeric skin and vacuum actuation, is presented. In particular, open-cell foam is exploited as a structural backbone, together with plastic rings, all embedded in a thin skin. The design and optimization combine numerical, analytical, and experimental data. Both static and dynamic analysis are performed. The weight of the optimized actuator is only 20 g. Nevertheless, a contraction ratio up to 50\% and a maximum payload of 3 kg can be achieved. From a dynamic point of view, a rise time of 0.5 s for the contraction phase is observed. Although hysteresis is significant when using the whole contraction span, it can be reduced (down to 11.5\%) by tuning both the vacuum range and the operating frequency for cyclic movements. Finally, to demonstrate the potentiality of this soft actuation approach, a 3 DoFs Stewart platform is built. The feasibility of performing smooth movements by exploiting open-loop control is shown through simple and more complex handwriting figures projected on the XY plane.},

From data on posture and maximum isometric joint torques, the upper-limb force feasible set of the hand was predicted by four models called force ellipsoid, scaled force ellipsoid, force polytope and scaled force polytope, which were compared with a measured force polytope. The volume, shape and force prediction errors were assessed. The scaled ellipsoid underestimated the maximal mean force, and the scaled polytope overestimated it. The scaled force ellipsoid underestimated the volume of the measured force distribution, whereas that of the scaled polytope was not significantly different from the measured distribution but exhibited larger variability. All the models characterized well the elongated shape of the measured force distribution. The angles between the main axes of the modelled ellipsoids and polytopes and that of the measured polytope were compared. The values ranged from 7.3° to 14.3°. Over the entire surface of the force ellipsoid, 39.7\% of the points had prediction errors less than 50 N; 33.6\% had errors between 50 and 100 N; and 26.8\% had errors greater than 100 N. For the force polytope, the percentages were 56.2\%, 28.3\% and 15.4\%, respectively.},

Investigation of the OLS-set allows us to quantify whether the replacement of real-valued (crisp) data by interval values can have a significant impact on our knowledge of the value of the OLS estimator. We show that in the general case, very elementary questions about properties of the OLS-set are computationally intractable (assuming P≠NP). We also focus on restricted versions of the general interval linear regression model to the crisp input case. Taking the advantage of the fact that in the crisp input - interval output model the OLS-set is a zonotope, we design both exact and approximate methods for its description. We also discuss special cases of the regression model, e.g. a model with repeated observations.},

This framework incorporates a Social Zonotope Network (SZN), a neural network that predicts future pedestrian reachable sets and plans future socially acceptable reachable set for the ego-agent. SZN generates the reachable sets as zonotopes for efficient reachability-based planning, collision checking, and online uncertainty parameterization. Locomotion-specific losses are added to the SZN training process to adhere to the dynamic limits of the bipedal robot that are not explicitly present in the human crowds data set. These loss functions enable the SZN to generate locomotion paths that are more dynamically feasible for improved tracking. SZN is integrated with a Model Predictive Controller (SZN-MPC) for footstep planning for our bipedal robot Digit. SZN-MPC solves for collision-free trajectory by optimizing through SZN's gradients. and Our results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in producing a socially acceptable path, with consistent locomotion velocity, and optimality. The SZN-MPC framework is validated with extensive simulations and hardware experiments.},

  abstract = {We propose a randomized algorithm for enumerating the vertices of a zonotope, which is a low-dimensional linear projection of a hypercube. The algorithm produces a pair of the zonotope’s vertices by sampling a random linear combination of the zonotope generators, where the combination’s weights are the signs of the product between the zonotope’s generator matrix and random vectors with normally distributed entries. We study the probability of recovering particular vertices and relate it to the vertices’ normal cones. This study shows that if we terminate the randomized algorithm before all vertices are recovered, then the convex hull of the resulting vertex set approximates the zonotope. In high dimensions, we expect the enumeration algorithm to be most appropriate as an approximation algorithm—particularly for cases when existing methods are not practical.},

Faults are modeled by discrete switches between linear models with bounded disturbances and measurement errors. Zonotopes are used to efficiently characterize the set of inputs that are guaranteed to lead to outputs that are consistent with at most one fault scenario. Provided that this set is nonempty, an element is then chosen that is minimally harmful with respect to other control objectives. This approach leads to a nonconvex optimization problem, but is shown to be equivalent to a mixed-integer quadratic program that can be solved efficiently. Methods are given for reducing the complexity of this program, including an observer-based method that drastically reduces the number of binary variables when many sampling times are required for diagnosis.},

To state results simply, consider a proportional-growth asymptotic, where for fixed δ, ρ in (0, 1), we have a sequence of matrices An,Nn and of integers kn with n/Nn → δ, kn/n → ρ as n → ∞. If each matrix An,Nn has its columns in general position, then fk(AIN )/fk(IN ) tends to zero or one depending on whether ρ {$>$} min(0, 2 − δ−1) or ρ {$<$} min(0, 2 − δ−1). Also, if each An,Nn is a random draw from a distribution which is invariant under right multiplication by signed permutations, then fk(ARN+ )/fk(RN+ ) tends almost surely to zero or one depending on whether ρ {$>$} min(0, 2 − δ−1) or ρ {$<$} min(0, 2 − δ−1). We make a variety of contrasts to related work on projections of the simplex and/or cross-polytope. These geometric face-counting results have implications for signal processing, information theory, inverse problems, and optimization. Indeed, face counting is related to conditions for uniqueness of solutions of underdetermined systems of linear equations.

Our main theoretical result is that, when the covariates are discrete, the infinite-dimensional latent variable distribution can be replaced with a finitedimensional version that is equivalent from an identification perspective. The finite-dimensional latent variable distribution is constructed in practice by enumerating regions of the latent variable space with a new and efficient cell enumeration algorithm for hyperplane arrangements. We then show that bounds on a certain class of counterfactual parameters can be computed by solving a sequence of linear programming problems, and show how the researcher can introduce additional assumptions as constraints in the linear programs. Finally, we apply the method to a mobile phone choice example with heterogeneous choice sets, as well as an airline entry game example.},

The NPMLE has also been proposed by Cosslett (1983) as an estimation method for single index linear models for binary response with random coefficients. However, computational difficulties have hindered its application. Combining recent developments in computational geometry and convex optimization we develop a new approach to computation for such models that dramatically increases their computational tractability. Consistency of the method is established for an expanded profile likelihood formulation. The methods are evaluated in simulation experiments, compared to the deconvolution methods of Gautier and Kitamura (2013) and illustrated in an application to modal choice for journeyto-work data in the Washington DC area.},

In each case the numbers of k-faces depend only on the incidences between intersections of the hyperplane, even though arrangements with the same intersection incidence pattern are not in general combinatorially isomorphic. We generalize this fact by demonstrating formulas for the numbers of k-faces of all Euclidean and projective arrangements, and the numbers of bounded k-faces of the former, as functions of the (semi)lattice of intersections of the hyperplanes, not dependent on the arrangement's combinatorial type.},

  abstract = {Collision detection has attracted attention of researchers for decades in the field of computer graphics, robot motion planning, computer aided design, etc. A large number of successful algorithms have been proposed and applied, which make use of convex polytopes and bounding volumes as primitives. However, algorithms for those shapes rely significantly on the complexity of the meshes. This paper deals with collision detection for shapes with simple and exact mathematical descriptions, such as ellipsoids and superquadrics. These primitives have a wide range of applications in representing complex objects and have much fewer parameters than meshes. The foundation of the proposed collision detection scheme relies on the closed-form Minkowski sums between ellipsoids and superquadrics in n-dimensional Euclidean space. The basic idea here is to shrink the ellipsoid into a point and expand each superquadric into a new offset surface with closed-form parametric expression. The solutions for detecting relative positions between a point and a general convex differentiable parametric surface in both 2D and 3D are derived, leading to an algorithm for exact collision detection. To compare between exact and inexact algorithms, an accuracy metric is introduced based on the Principal Kinematic Formula (PKF). The proposed algorithm is then compared with existing wellknown algorithms: Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK) and Algebraic Separation Conditions (ASC). The results show that the proposed algorithm performs competitively with these efficient checkers.},

  abstract = {Ellipsoids are a common representation for reachability analysis because they are closed under affine maps and allow conservative approximation of Minkowski sums; this enables one to incorporate uncertainty and linearization error in a dynamical system by exapnding the size of the reachable set. Zonotopes, a type of symmetric, convex polytope, are similarly frequently used due to efficient numerical implementation of affine maps and exact Minkowski sums. Both of these representations also enable efficient, convex collision detection for fault detection or formal verification tasks, wherein one checks if the reachable set of a system collides (i.e., intersects) with an unsafe set. However, both representations often result in conservative representations for reachable sets of arbitrary systems, and neither is closed under intersection. Recently, constrained zonotopes and constrained polynomial zonotopes have been shown to overcome some of these conservatism challenges, and are closed under intersection. However, constrained zonotopes can not represent shapes with smooth boundaries such as ellipsoids, and constrained polynomial zonotopes can require solving a non-convex program for collision checking (i.e., fault detection). This paper introduces ellipsotopes, a set representation that is closed under affine maps, Minkowski sums, and intersections. Ellipsotopes combine the advantages of ellipsoids and zonotopes, and enable convex collision checking at the expense of more conservative reachable sets than constrained polynomial zonotopes. The utility of this representation is demonstrated on several examples.},

  abstract = {Set-based computations become increasingly popular for safety-critical systems to ensure properties of controllers and observers. To efficiently compute various set operations, one often uses different set representations and conversions between them. Two popular set representations, for which scalable conversion algorithms do not yet exist, are zonotopes and ellipsoids. We provide computational approaches for all four conversion cases, i.e., overapproximations and underapproximations from zonotopes to ellipsoids and vice versa. By using upper bounds on the maximum and lower bounds on the minimum Euclidean norm of a given zonotope, our approaches have polynomial complexity and thus can be used for high-dimensional spaces. We show that the tightness of our approaches directly depends on the tightness of the Euclidean norm. Numerical experiments demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed methods.},

If perfect arithmetic is used, then the sequence of ellipsoids generated by the method comerges to a set of ellipsoids, which share some of the properties of the classical Hessian at an optimum point of a function; and thus the ellipsoid method is quite analogous to a variable metric quasi-Newton method.},

We revisit Pisier's argument and show the existence of a different position, which guarantees the same estimates for randomly sampled sections with high-probability. As an application, we obtain a random version of V. Milman's Quotient-of-Subspace Theorem, asserting that in the above position, typical quotients of subspaces are isomorphic to Euclidean, with a distance estimate which matches the best-known deterministic one (and beating all prior estimates which hold with high-probability). Our main novel ingredient is a new position of convex bodies, whose existence we establish by using topological arguments and a fixed-point theorem.},

The first one (M1) considered binary muscular activation and a simple MIF scaling method based on the weight and muscle length of the subject. The second one (M2) introduces cocontraction factors determined from sEMG. The third one (M3) considers the cocontraction factors and the MIF identification. Finally, M1, M2 and M3 are compared with end-effector force measurement. M3 outperforms the two other methods on FFS prediction demonstrating the validity and the usefulness of MIF identification and the consideration of the cocontraction factors.},

This method uses the available net wrench set, which is the set of all wrenches that a cable robot can apply to its surroundings without violating tension limits in the cables. The geometric properties of this set permit calculation of the boundaries of the WFW for planar, spatial, and point-mass cable robots. Complete analytical expressions for the WFW boundaries are detailed for a planar cable robot and a spatial point-mass cable robot. The analytically determined boundaries are verified by comparison with numerical results. Based on this, several workspace properties are shown for point-mass cable robots. Finally, it is shown how this workspace-generation approach can be used to analytically formulate other workspaces},

  abstract = {The extent to which specific muscles may limit maximum isometric force production is largely unknown. This study investigated shoulder muscle activity in six muscles and maximum force generation at the hand in three directions, while in eight different working positions. Ten right hand dominant, university-aged female participants completed twenty-four maximal isometric force hand exertions against a handle positioned by a robot arm within a 3-dimensional simulated workspace. A multivariate, full factorial ANOVA indicated a reach distance main effect where 11\% greater force production occurred at the lesser reach distance. A target handle elevation and force direction interaction effect on maximum force production also existed. These findings add to normative static strength data for hand locations typical of an operating work envelope. Although hand force was significantly influenced by position in each direction (p {$<$} 0.05), muscle EMG was not influenced in any of the six muscles measured. No muscle achieved 100\% MVE in any of the tested conditions, with the highest total muscle activity recorded at 86\% MVE for the Pectoralis Major -- sternal origin. Collectively, these data better demonstrate that the location and direction of work presentation influences force outputs more than specific muscle demands (of those measured), and should be considered in evaluating workstations.},

  abstract = {Currently, contrasting views exist regarding which body and arm postures are most effective for eliciting maximal voluntary exertions in the shoulder muscles. Informed exertion standardization may improve comparisons between subjects and muscle groups for normalized electromyography values. Additionally, identifying exertions that can produce equivalent maximal electrical activity values can reduce experimental setup time and reduce the likelihood of fatigue development. This research study examined twelve posture and force direction defined test exertions to identify those that elicited maximal electrical activity from the deltoid (anterior and middle fibres) and pectoralis major (clavicular and sternal heads). Further, the question of whether a single test exertion could obtain maximal electrical activity from multiple muscle fascicles was explored. Maximal activation was demonstrated for the deltoid during several exertions that incorporated an upward force exertion and the pectoralis major for multiple exertions that included an inward force direction. Finally, two test exertions produced maximal electrical activity from both muscles of interest. This research supports the notion that a range of exertions can elicit maximal electrical activity from a muscle, rather than one specific exertion. This suggests that researchers may be able to leverage a smaller set of test exertions to evaluate multiple muscles simultaneously without loss of data quality, and thereby decrease overall experimental data collection time while maintaining high fidelity data.},

We propose an introduction of a muscle coordinate system consisting of the bi-articular muscles as well as the mono-articular muscles instead of a conventional joint coordinate system consisting of only the mono-articular muscles without the bi-articular muscles to discuss an interface between man and machine. The output force distribution developed at the wrist joint of the human arm under isometric and maximal effort conditions demonstrates a hexagonal shape. Since complex muscle arrangements of the human arm could be simplified into one antagonistic pair of the bi-articular muscles and two antagonistic pairs of the mono-articular muscles (functionally effective muscular strengths), a robot arm provided with three pairs of muscles was built. The robot arm operated with the muscle coordinate system demonstrated hexagonal shape output force distributions. Whereas, the robot arm operated with the joint coordinate system showed quadrangular output force distributions. A characteristic of the hexagonal force distribution made it possible to evaluate individual functionally effective muscular strengths from the human arm output force distribution. The results obtained here will lead a new virtual human model to be more realistic than the conventional model operated with the joint coordinate system. The idea will also be useful for a human-friendly robot.},

This hope has been realized, and some astonishingly simple and accurate relations have been found, relations, moreover, which (among other things) determine the effect of load on speed of shortening, allow the form of the isometric contraction to be predicted, and are the basis of the so-called ``visco-elasticity'' of skeletal muscle. This paper is divided into three parts. In Part I further developments of the technique are described: everything has depended on the technique, so no apology is needed for a rather full description of it and of the precautions necessary. In Part II the results themselves are described and discussed. In Part III the ``visco-elastic'' properties of active muscle are shown to be a consequence of the properties described in Part II.},

This transformation is complex, not only because the properties of muscles are complex, but because the tendon affects the transmission of muscle force to the skeleton. This review focuses on how to synthesize basic properties of muscle and tendon to construct models applicable to studies of coordination. After a review of the properties of muscle and tendon, their integrated ability to generate force statically and dynamically is studied by formulating a generic model of the "musculotendon actuator", which has only one parameter, the ratio of tendon length at rest to muscle fiber length at rest. To illustrate the utility of the model, it is analyzed to show how this one parameter specifies whether excitation-contraction or musculotendon contraction is the rate-limiting process of force generation, whether elastic energy is stored in tendon or muscle, and whether hip- and knee-extensor actuators function as springs or dashpots during walking.},

  abstract = {The generation of muscle-actuated simulations that accurately represent the movement of old adults requires a model that accounts for changes in muscle properties that occur with aging. An objective of this study was to adjust the parameters of Hill-type musculo-tendon models to reflect nominal age-related changes in muscle mechanics that have been reported in the literature. A second objective was to determine whether using the parametric adjustments resulted in simulated dynamic ankle torque behavior similar to that seen in healthy old adults. The primary parameter adjustment involved decreasing maximum isometric muscle forces to account for the loss of muscle mass and specific strength with age. A review of the literature suggested the need for other modest adjustments that account for prolonged muscular deactivation, a reduction in maximum contraction velocity, greater passive muscle stiffness and increased normalized force capacity during lengthening contractions. With age-related changes incorporated, a musculo-tendon model was used to simulate isometric and isokinetic contractions of ankle plantarflexor and dorsiflexor muscles. The model predicted that ankle plantarflexion power output during 120 deg/s shortening contractions would be over 40\% lower in old adults compared to healthy young adults. These power losses with age exceed the 30\% loss in isometric strength assumed in the model but are comparable to 39--44\% reductions in ankle power outputs measured in healthy old adults of approximately 70 years of age. Thus, accounting for age-related changes in muscle properties, other than decreased maximum isometric force, may be particularly important when simulating movements that require substantial power development.},

We first consider the problem of selecting a general disjunction and show that the problem of selecting an optimal such disjunction, according to specific criteria described herein, is \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{NP\}\$-hard. We further show that the problem remains \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{NP\}\$-hard even for binary programs or when considering certain restricted classes of disjunctions. We observe that the problem of deciding whether a given inequality is a split inequality can be reduced to one of the above problems, which leads to a proof that the problem is \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{NP\}\$-complete.}

This paper introduces 24 possible distance measures based on the Hausdorff distance between two point sets. These measures can be used to match two sets of edge points extracted from any two objects. Based on our experiments on synthetic images containing various levels of noise, we determined that one of these distance measures, called the modified Hausdorff distance (MHD) has the best performance for object matching. The advantages of MHD over other distances are also demonstrated on several edge maps of objects extracted from real images.},

  abstract = {Muscle-driven simulations of human and animal motion are widely used to complement physical experiments for studying movement dynamics. Musculotendon models are an essential component of muscle-driven simulations, yet neither the computational speed nor the biological accuracy of the simulated forces has been adequately evaluated. Here we compare the speed and accuracy of three musculotendon models: two with an elastic tendon (an equilibrium model and a damped equilibrium model) and one with a rigid tendon. Our simulation benchmarks demonstrate that the equilibrium and damped equilibrium models produce similar force profiles but have different computational speeds. At low activation, the damped equilibrium model is 29 times faster than the equilibrium model when using an explicit integrator and 3 times faster when using an implicit integrator; at high activation, the two models have similar simulation speeds. In the special case of simulating a muscle with a short tendon, the rigid-tendon model produces forces that match those generated by the elastic-tendon models, but simulates 2-54 times faster when an explicit integrator is used and 6-31 times faster when an implicit integrator is used. The equilibrium, damped equilibrium, and rigid-tendon models reproduce forces generated by maximally-activated biological muscle with mean absolute errors less than 8.9\%, 8.9\%, and 20.9\% of the maximum isometric muscle force, respectively. When compared to forces generated by submaximally-activated biological muscle, the forces produced by the equilibrium, damped equilibrium, and rigid-tendon models have mean absolute errors less than 16.2\%, 16.4\%, and 18.5\%, respectively. To encourage further development of musculotendon models, we provide implementations of each of these models in OpenSim version 3.1 and benchmark data online, enabling others to reproduce our results and test their models of musculotendon dynamics.},

This setting allows a general theoretical characterization, where critical factors to the optimization are discovered. We also prove that optimization problems with Local Lipschitz continuity can be solved in polynomial time by proper configurations of this framework. Following the critical factors, we propose the randomized coordinate shrinking classification algorithm to learn the model, forming the RACOS algorithm, for optimization in continuous and discrete domains.

In particular, based on domain-specific knowledge about algorithms of the DLA kernels, we use a collection of parameterized code templates to formulate a number of commonly occurring instruction sequences within the optimized low-level C code of these DLA kernels. Then, our framework uses a specialized low-level C optimizer to identify instruction sequences that match the pre-defined code templates and thereby translates them into extremely efficient SSE/AVX instructions. The DLA kernels generated by our templatebased approach surpass the implementations of Intel MKL and AMD ACML BLAS libraries, on both Intel Sandy Bridge and AMD Piledriver processors.},

  abstract = {Muscle structure is an essential component in typical computational models of the musculoskeletal system. Almost all musculoskeletal models represent muscle geometry using a set of line segments. The straight-line approach limits models' ability to accurately predict the paths of muscles with complex geometry. This approach needs knowledge of how the muscle changes shape and interacts with fundamental structures like muscles, bones, and joints that move. Moreover, the moment arms are supposed to be equivalent to all the fibers in the muscle. This study aims to create a shoulder musculoskeletal model that includes complex muscle geometries. We reconstructed the shape of fibers in the entire volume of six muscles adjacent to the shoulder using an automated technique. This method generates many fibers from the surface geometry of the skeletal muscle and its attachment areas. Highly discretized muscle representations for all muscles were created and used to simulate different shoulder movements. The moment arms of each muscle were calculated and validated against cadaveric measurements and models of the same muscles from the literature. We found that simulations using the developed musculoskeletal models generated more realistic geometries, which expands the physical representation of muscles compared to line segments. The shoulder musculoskeletal model with complex muscle geometry is created to increase the anatomical reality of models and the lines action of muscle fibers, and to be used for finite element investigations.},

Muscle moment-arm data for sub-regions of the shoulder musculature during humeral elevation are currently not available. The tendon-excursion method was used to measure instantaneous muscle moment arms in eight entire upper-extremity cadaver specimens. Significant differences in moment arms were reported across sub-regions of the deltoid, pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, subscapularis, infraspinatus and supraspinatus (P {$<$} 0.01). The most effective abductors were the middle and anterior deltoid, whereas the most effective adductors were the teres major, middle and inferior latissimus dorsi (lumbar vertebrae and iliac crest fibers, respectively), and middle and inferior pectoralis major (sternal and lower-costal fibers, respectively). In flexion, the superior pectoralis major (clavicular fibers), anterior and posterior supraspinatus, and anterior deltoid were the most effective flexors, whereas the teres major and posterior deltoid had the largest extensor moment arms. Division of multi-pennate shoulder muscles of broad origins into sub-regions highlighted distinct functional differences across those sub-regions. Most significantly, we found that the superior sub-region of the pectoralis major had the capacity to exert substantial torque in flexion, whereas the middle and inferior sub-regions tended to behave as a stabilizer and extensor, respectively. Knowledge of moment arm differences between muscle sub-regions may assist in identifying the functional effects of muscle sub-region tears, assist surgeons in planning tendon reconstructive surgery, and aid in the development and validation of biomechanical computer models used in implant design.},

  abstract = {Computational models of the musculoskeletal system are scientific tools used to study human movement, quantify the effects of injury and disease, plan surgical interventions, or control realistic high-dimensional articulated prosthetic limbs. If the models are sufficiently accurate, they may embed complex relationships within the sensorimotor system. These potential benefits are limited by the challenge of implementing fast and accurate musculoskeletal computations. A typical hand muscle spans over 3 degrees of freedom (DOF), wrapping over complex geometrical constraints that change its moment arms and lead to complex posture-dependent variation in torque generation. Here, we report a method to accurately and efficiently calculate musculotendon length and moment arms across all physiological postures of the forearm muscles that actuate the hand and wrist. Then, we use this model to test the hypothesis that the functional similarities of muscle actions are embedded in muscle structure. The posture dependent muscle geometry, moment arms and lengths of modeled muscles were captured using autogenerating polynomials that expanded their optimal selection of terms using information measurements. The iterative process approximated 33 musculotendon actuators, each spanning up to 6 DOFs in an 18 DOF model of the human arm and hand, defined over the full physiological range of motion. Using these polynomials, the entire forearm anatomy could be computed in {$<$}10 {$\mu$}s, which is far better than what is required for real-time performance, and with low errors in moment arms (below 5\%) and lengths (below 0.4\%). Moreover, we demonstrate that the number of elements in these autogenerating polynomials does not increase exponentially with increasing muscle complexity; complexity increases linearly instead. Dimensionality reduction using the polynomial terms alone resulted in clusters comprised of muscles with similar functions, indicating the high accuracy of approximating models. We propose that this novel method of describing musculoskeletal biomechanics might further improve the applications of detailed and scalable models to describe human movement.},

  abstract = {A model of the knee in the sagittal plane was developed to study the forces in the ligaments induced by isometric contractions of the extensor and flexor muscles. The geometry of the distal femur was obtained from cadaver data. The tibial plateau and patellar facet were modeled as flat surfaces. Eleven elastic elements were used to describe the mechanical behavior of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments (ACL and PCL), the medial and lateral collateral ligaments (MCL and LCL), and the posterior capsule. The model knee was actuated by 11 musculotendinous units, each muscle represented by a Hill-type contractile element, a series-elastic element, and a parallel-elastic element. Tendon was assumed to be elastic. The response of the model to anterior-posterior drawer suggests that the geometrical and mechanical properties of the model ligaments approximate the behavior of real ligaments in the intact knee. Calculations for a simulated quadriceps leg raise indicate further that the two-dimensional model reproduces the response of the three-dimensional knee under similar conditions of loading and constraint. During maximum isometric contractions of the quadriceps, the model ACL is loaded from full extension to 80{$^\circ$}C of flexion; the model PCL is loaded at 70{$^\circ$} of flexion and greater. For maximum isometric extension, ACL forces in the range 0--20{$^\circ$} of flexion depend most heavily upon the force-length properties of the quadriceps. At flexion angles greater than 20{$^\circ$}, cruciate ligament forces are determined by the geometry of the articulating surfaces of the bones. During isolated contractions of the hamstrings and gastrocnemius muscles, the model ACL is loaded from full extension to 10{$^\circ$} of flexion; the model PCL is loaded at all flexion angles greater than 10{$^\circ$}. Isolated contractions of the flexor muscles cannot unload the ACL near full extension, as the behavior of the ACL in this region is governed by the shapes of the bones. At 10{$^\circ$} of flexion or greater, the overall pattern of PCL force is explained by the force-length properties of the hamstrings and by the geometrical arrangement of the flexor muscles about the knee.},

Leg tendons save energy in this way when birds and mammals run, and an aponeurosis in the back is also important in galloping mammals. Tendons may have similar energy-saving roles in other modes of locomotion, for example in cetacean swimming. Secondly, tendons can recoil elastically much faster than muscles can shorten, enabling animals to jump further than they otherwise could. Thirdly, tendon elasticity affects the control of muscles, enhancing force control at the expense of position control.},

  abstract = {There is little known about kinetic changes in anterior cruciate ligament deficiency (ACLD) combined with meniscal tears during jogging. Therefore, 29 male patients with injured ACLs and 15 healthy male volunteers were recruited for this study to investigate kinetic abnormalities in male patients after ACL deficiency combined with a meniscal injury during jogging. Based on experimental data measured by an optical tracking system, a subject-specific musculoskeletal model was employed to estimate the tibiofemoral joint kinetics during jogging. Between-limb and interpatient differences were compared by the analysis of variance. The results showed that decreased knee joint forces and moments of both legs in ACLD patients were detected during the stance phase compared to the control group. Meanwhile, compared with ACLD knees, significantly fewer contact forces and flexion moments in ACLD combined with lateral and medial meniscal injury groups were found at the mid-stance, and ACLD with medial meniscal injury group showed a lower axial moment in the loading response (p {$<$} 0.05). In conclusion, ACLD knees exhibit reduced tibiofemoral joint forces and moments during jogging when compared with control knees. A combination of meniscus injuries in the ACLD-affected side exhibited abnormal kinetic alterations at the loading response and mid-stance phase.},

  abstract = {Over the past fifty years there has been considerable development in motion analysis systems and in computer simulation modelling of sports movements while the relevance and importance of functional variability of sports technique has become increasingly recognised. Technical developments for experimental work have led to increased, and still increasing, subject numbers. Increased subjects per study give better statistical power, the ability to utilise different data analyses, and thus the determination of more subtle and nuanced factors. The overall number of studies has also increased massively. Most actions in sport can, and have, been studied at some level with even the more challenging ones, such as player on player impacts, having some developing research. Computer simulation models of sports movements have ranged from simple (one or two segment) models to very complex musculoskeletal models and have used parameters ranging from the generic to individual-specific. Simple models have given insights into the key mechanics of movement while individual-specific model optimisations have been used to improve athlete performance. Our depth of understanding of the mechanics of sports techniques has increased across a wide range of sports. In the future there is likely to be more development and use of markerless motion capture, individual-specific model parameters, and more consideration of motor control aspects in the analysis of sports technique.},

Participants (n = 20) undertook two hours of laboratory-based sitting computer work to investigate changes in discomfort and cognitive function (sustained attention and problem solving), along with muscle fatigue, movement and mental state. Over time, discomfort increased in all body areas (total body IRR [95\% confidence interval]: 1.43 [1.33{$^-$}1.53]) reaching clinically meaningful levels in the low back and hip/thigh/buttock areas. Creative problem solving errors increased ({$\beta$} = 0.25 [0.03{$^-$}1.47]) while sustained attention did not change. There was no change in erector spinae, trapezius, rectus femoris, biceps femoris and external oblique median frequency or amplitude; low back angle changed towards less lordosis, pelvis movement increased, and mental state deteriorated. There were no substantial correlations between discomfort and cognitive function. The observed changes suggest prolonged sitting may have consequences for musculoskeletal discomfort and cognitive function and breaks to interrupt prolonged sitting are recommended.},

METHODS: Relevant publications and material on exposure assessment techniques have been gathered for inclusion in this review. RESULTS: The methods have been categorized under three main headings: (1) self-reports from workers can be used to collect data on workplace exposure to both physical and psychosocial factors by using methods that include worker diaries, interviews and questionnaires; (2) observational methods that may be further subdivided between (a) simpler techniques developed for systematically recording workplace exposure that enable an observer to assess and record data on a number of factors using specifically designed pro-forma sheets for establishing priorities for workplace intervention; and (b) advanced techniques developed for the assessment of postural variation for highly dynamic activities that record data either on videotape or are computer analysed using dedicated software; (3) direct measurements using monitoring instruments that rely on sensors attached directly to the subject for the measurement of exposure variables at work. CONCLUSIONS: The choice between the methods available will depend upon the application concerned and the objectives of the study. General, observation-based assessments appear to provide the levels of costs, capacity, versatility, generality and exactness best matched to the needs of occupational safety and health practitioners (or those from related professions) who have limited time and resources at their disposal and need a basis for establishing priorities for intervention.},

  abstract = {Pushing and pulling tasks are increasingly prevalent in industrial workplaces. Few studies have investigated low-back biomechanical risk factors associated with pushing, and we are aware of none that has quantified spinal stability during pushing exertions. Data recorded from 11 healthy participants performing isometric pushing exertions demonstrated that trunk posture, vector force direction of the applied load, and trunk moment were influenced (p {$<$} .01) by exertion level, elevation of the handle for the pushing task, and foot position. A biomechanical model was used to analyze the posture and hand force data gathered from the pushing exertions. Model results indicate that pushing exertions provide significantly (p {$<$} .01) less stability than lifting when antagonistic cocontraction is ignored. However, stability can be augmented by recruitment of muscle cocontraction. Results suggest that cocontraction may be recruited to compensate for the fact that equilibrium mechanics provide little intrinsic trunk stiffness and stability during pushing exertions. If one maintains stability by means of cocontraction, additional spinal load is thereby created, increasing the risk of overload injury. Thus it is important to consider muscle cocontraction when evaluating the biomechanics of pushing exertions. Potential applications of this research include improved assessment of biomechanical risk factors for the design of industrial pushing tasks.},

Installation of height-adjustable workstations has been proposed as a feasible approach for reducing occupational sitting time in office workers. Aims To provide an accurate overview of the controlled trials that have evaluated the effects of heightadjustable workstation interventions on workplace sitting time in office-based workers. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted up until March 2014 in the following databases: Medline, PsychINFO, CENTRAL, EMBASE and PEDro.To identify unpublished studies and grey literature, the reference lists of relevant official or scientific web pages were also checked. Studies assessing the effectiveness of height-adjustable workstations using a randomized or non-randomized controlled design were included. Results The initial search yielded a total of 8497 citations. After a thorough selection process, five studies were included with 172 participants. A formal quality assessment indicated that risk of bias was high in all studies and heterogeneity in interventions and outcomes prevented meta-analysis. Nevertheless, all studies reported that height-adjustable workstation interventions reduced occupational sitting time in office workers. There was insufficient evidence to determine effects on other relevant health outcomes (e.g. body composition, musculoskeletal symptoms, mental health). Conclusions There is insufficient evidence to make firm conclusions regarding the effects of installing heightadjustable workstations on sedentary behaviour and associated health outcomes in office workers. Larger and longer term controlled studies are needed, which include more representative populations.},

This paper delineates the development and implementation of control mechanisms in humanoid robots, aiming to emulate human motion and interaction with unstructured environments. By assimilating principles of biomechanics, including joint dynamics, balance, and gait patterns, a novel control architecture is proposed. The architecture employs predictive modeling and adaptive feedback loops, facilitating real-time adjustments akin to human reflexive responses. Key contributions include the synchronization of sensory inputs with motor actions to achieve dynamic stability and fluidity in locomotion, even under uncertain conditions. Experiments conducted demonstrate significant enhancements in the robots' adaptability, efficiency in energy usage, and proficiency in executing complex tasks. Through rigorous testing, humanoid robots exhibit unprecedented levels of dexterity and robustness, marking a milestone in their evolution. The fusion of biomechanical models with advanced robotics not only propels the capabilities of humanoid robots but also enriches the understanding of human motor control, offering potential applications in prosthetics and rehabilitation. This research signifies a step towards more anthropomorphic robots capable of seamlessly integrating into human-centric environments.},

  abstract = {Hypothesis Musculoskeletal computer models provide valuable insights into shoulder biomechanics. The shoulder is a complex joint composed of glenohumeral, scapulothoracic, acromioclavicular, and sternoclavicular articulations, whose function is largely dependent on the many muscles spanning these joints. However, the range of patient-to-patient variability in shoulder function is largely unknown. We therefore assessed the sensitivity of glenohumeral forces to population-based model input parameters that were likely to influence shoulder function. Methods We constructed musculoskeletal models of the shoulder in the AnyBody Modeling System (AnyBody Technology, Aalborg, Denmark). We used inverse dynamics and static optimization to solve for glenohumeral joint forces during a simulated shoulder elevation. We generated 1000 AnyBody models by uniformly distributing the following input parameters: subject height, scapulohumeral rhythm, humeral head radius, and acromiohumeral interval. Results Increasing body height increased glenohumeral joint forces. Increasing the ratio of scapulothoracic to glenohumeral elevation also increased forces. Increasing humeral head radius and acromiohumeral interval decreased forces. The relative sensitivity of glenohumeral joint forces to input parameters was dependent on the angle of shoulder elevation. We developed an efficient method of generating and simulating musculoskeletal models representing a large population of shoulder arthroplasty patients. We found that scapulohumeral rhythm had a significant influence on glenohumeral joint force. Conclusions This finding underscores the importance of more accurately measuring and simulating scapulothoracic motion rather than using fixed ratios or average scapulothoracic motion. This modeling approach can be used to generate virtual populations for conducting efficient simulations and generating statistical conclusions.},

This approach is limited because it does not perform well for outliers, and it does not model the effects of population parameter variability. The purpose of this study was to simulate variability in musculoskeletal parameters on glenohumeral external rotation strength in healthy normals, and in rotator cuff tear case using a Monte Carlo model. The goal was to determine if variability in musculoskeletal parameters could quantifiably explain variability in glenohumeral external rotation strength. Multivariate Gamma distributions for musculoskeletal architecture and moment arm were constructed from empirical data. Gamma distributions of measured joint strength were constructed. Parameters were sampled from the distributions and input to the model to predict muscle forces and joint torques. The model predicted measured joint torques for healthy normals, subjects with supraspinatus tears, and subjects with infraspinatus-supraspinatus tears with small error. Muscle forces for the three conditions were predicted and compared. Variability in measured torques can be explained by differences in parameter variability.},

OpenSim is a popular open source tool used for this purpose, mapping between biological specifications and an underlying generalized coordinate multibody system called Simbody. One quantity of interest to biomechanical researchers and clinicians is ``muscle moment arm,'' a measure of the effectiveness of a muscle at contributing to a particular motion over a range of configurations. OpenSim can automatically calculate these quantities for any muscle once a model has been built. For simple cases, this calculation is the same as the conventional moment arm calculation in mechanical engineering. But a muscle may span several joints (e.g., wrist, neck, back) and may follow a convoluted path over various curved surfaces. A biological joint may require several bodies or even a mechanism to accurately represent in the multibody model (e.g., knee, shoulder). In these situations we need a careful definition of muscle moment arm that is analogous to the mechanical engineering concept, yet generalized to be of use to biomedical researchers. Here we present some biomechanical modeling challenges and how they are resolved in OpenSim and Simbody to yield biologically meaningful muscle moment arms.},

In this framework, the purpose of this study was to compare measured maximal isometric force capabilities at the hand in a set of Cartesian directions with forces computed from a musculoskeletal model of the upper-limb. The results were represented under the form of a measured force polytope (MFP) and a musculoskeletal force polytope (MSFP). Both of them were obtained from the convex hull of measured and simulated force vectors endpoints. Nine subjects participated to the experiment. For one posture recorded with an optoelectronic system, maximum isometric forces exerted at the hand were recorded in twenty six directions of the Cartesian space with a triaxial force sensor. Results showed significant differences between the polytopes global shapes. The MSFP was more elongated than the MFP. Concerning the polytopes volumes, no significant difference was found. Mean maximal isometric forces provided by MFP and MSFP were 509.6 (118.4)N and 627.9 (73.3)N respectively. Moreover, the angle between the main axes of the two polytopes was 5.5 (2.3){$^\circ$} on average. Finally, RMS error values between MFP and MSFP were lower than 100N in 88\% of the considered directions. The proposed MSFP based on a musculoskeletal model gave interesting information on optimal force orientation parameters. The possible applications in the frame of ergonomics, rehabilitation and biomechanics are proposed and discussed.},

  abstract = {Robotic platforms that physically interact with human operators are allowing new control strategies and applications. Many industrial scenarios that include collaborative robots have not been explored yet, due to the new challenges in terms of safety. Integrating estimates of the operator's psycho-physical state can alleviate this burden. In physical Human-Robot Collaboration (pHRC), having an estimate of the operator's strength capacity can help design and implement appropriate control strategies. For pHRC tasks, the physical interaction point usually occurs at the operator's hand. Therefore, a model-based strategy was implemented to have a real-time estimation of the strength capacity of the operator's upper limb. First, the model has been simplified to reduce the complexity of the problem. The model was then used to obtain offline estimations of the strength capacity, that were subsequently curve-fitted in a linear model to allow a real-time estimation. An experiment was then carried out to compare the results of the approximated model with human data. Finally, in a pilot case, the approximated model was used for an Assistance-As-Needed (AAN) strategy in an abrasive blasting application. Results demonstrate that this simplified method for estimating the strength capacity of the upper limb is a viable solution for applications that comply with the assumptions made. The results of the field trial with the AAN strategy also demonstrate that the approximated model can be used to implement assistive strategies for dynamic support.},

A promising use for musculoskeletal models is to model the physical capabilities of the human body, for example, estimating the strength at the hand. Several methods of modelling and representing human strength with musculoskeletal models have been used in ergonomic analysis, human-robot interaction and robotic assistance. However, it is currently unclear which methods best suit modelling and representing limb strength. This paper compares existing methods for calculating and representing the strength of the upper limb using musculoskeletal models.

Sensitivity analysis is a crucial step in the model building and result communication process. Through sensitivity analysis we gain essential insights on model behavior, on its structure and on its response to changes in the model inputs. Several interrogations are possible and several sensitivity analysis methods have been developed, giving rise to a vast and growing literature. We present an overview of available methods, structuring them into local and global methods. For local methods, we discuss Tornado diagrams, one way sensitivity functions, differentiation-based methods and scenario decomposition through finite change sensitivity indices, providing a unified view of the associated sensitivity measures. We then analyze global sensitivity methods, first discussing screening methods such as sequential bifurcation and the Morris method. We then address variance-based, moment-independent and value of information-based sensitivity methods. We discuss their formalization in a common rationale and present recent results that permit the estimation of global sensitivity measures by post-processing the sample generated by a traditional Monte Carlo simulation. We then investigate in detail the methodological issues concerning the crucial step of correctly interpreting the results of a sensitivity analysis. A classical example is worked out to illustrate some of the approaches.},

  abstract = {A family of multivariate representations is introduced to capture the input--output relationships of high-dimensional physical systems with many input variables. A systematic mapping procedure between the inputs and outputs is prescribed to reveal the hierarchy of correlations amongst the input variables. It is argued that for most well-defined physical systems, only relatively low-order correlations of the input variables are expected to have an impact upon the output. The high-dimensional model representations (HDMR) utilize this property to present an exact hierarchical representation of the physical system. At each new level of HDMR, higher-order correlated effects of the input variables are introduced. Tests on several systems indicate that the few lowest-order terms are often sufficient to represent the model in equivalent form to good accuracy. The input variables may be either finite-dimensional (i.e., a vector of parameters chosen from the Euclidean space \$\${\textbackslash}mathcal\{R\}{\textasciicircum}n\$\$) or may be infinite-dimensional as in the function space \$\$\{{\textbackslash}text\{C\}\}{\textasciicircum}n {\textbackslash}left[ \{0,1\} {\textbackslash}right]\$\$. Each hierarchical level of HDMR is obtained by applying a suitable projection operator to the output function and each of these levels are orthogonal to each other with respect to an appropriately defined inner product. A family of HDMRs may be generated with each having distinct character by the use of different choices of projection operators. Two types of HDMRs are illustrated in the paper: ANOVA-HDMR is the same as the analysis of variance (ANOVA) decomposition used in statistics. Another cut-HDMR will be shown to be computationally more efficient than the ANOVA decomposition. Application of the HDMR tools can dramatically reduce the computational effort needed in representing the input--output relationships of a physical system. In addition, the hierarchy of identified correlation functions can provide valuable insight into the model structure. The notion of a model in the paper also encompasses input--output relationships developed with laboratory experiments, and the HDMR concepts are equally applicable in this domain. HDMRs can be classified as non-regressive, non-parametric learning networks. Selected applications of the HDMR concept are presented along with a discussion of its general utility.},

SA experiments were carried out at sub-model level on rice crops grown under different environmental conditions. Results highlighted the lack of linearity between the total-order sensitivity estimates provided by E-FAST and Morris, although the concordance (TDCC) between the parameter rankings obtained with the two methods was always significant at the 0.05 level for parameters involved with crop growth and for those involved with phenological development for STICS, whereas it was significant at the 0.10 level for the phenology parameters of CropSyst and WOFOST. Given Morris required less than 3\% of the model executions needed by E-FAST, our results allow considering Morris as a suitable alternative to more demanding SA methods when ranking parameters or discriminating between influential and non-influential model factors are the SA goals, especially in computationally expensive SA studies.},

Sensitivity was calculated with respect to four muscle-tendon parameters: muscle peak isometric force, muscle optimal length, muscle pennation, and tendon slack length. Results obtained from a musculoskeletal model of average strength showed highest sensitivity to tendon slack length, followed by muscle optimal length and peak isometric force, which is consistent with existing studies. Muscle pennation angle was relatively insensitive. The analysis was repeated after adapting the musculoskeletal model to represent persons with varying severities of physical impairment. Results showed that utilizing the weakened model significantly increased the sensitivity of the calculated strength at the hand, with parameters previously insensitive becoming highly sensitive. This increased sensitivity presents a significant challenge in applications utilizing musculoskeletal models to represent impaired individuals.},

However, current methods for producing personalized models require dense, biomechanical datasets that include expensive and time-consuming physiological measurements. For personalized models to be clinically useful, we must be able to rapidly generate models from simple, easy to collect data. In this context, the objective of this paper is to evaluate if and how simple data, namely height/weight and pinch force data, can be used to achieve model personalization via machine learning. Using simulated lateral pinch force measurements from a synthetic population of 40,000 randomly generated subjects, we train neural networks to estimate four Hill-type muscle model parameters and bone density. We compare parameter estimates to the true parameters of 10,000 additional synthetic subjects. We also generate new personalized models using the parameter estimates and perform new lateral pinch simulations to compare predicted forces using these personalized models to those generated using a baseline model. We demonstrate that increasing force measurement complexity reduces the root-mean-square error in the majority of parameter estimates. Additionally, musculoskeletal models using neural network-based parameter estimates provide up to an 80\% reduction in absolute error in simulated forces when compared to a generic model. Thus, easily obtained force measurements may be suitable for personalizing models of the thumb, although extending the method to more tasks and models involving other joints likely requires additional measurements.},

  abstract = {The majority of musculoskeletal modelling studies investigating healthy populations use generic models linearly scaled to roughly match an individual's anthropometry. Generic models disregard the considerable variation in musculoskeletal geometry and tissue properties between individuals. This study investigated the physiological implications of personalizing musculoskeletal model geometry (body segment mass, inertia, joint center, and maximum isometric muscle force). Nine healthy athletes performed ten repetitions of 15 meter sprints at 75-95\% of their maximum sprinting speed and ten repetitions of unanticipated sidestep cut trials with a 4.5-5.5 m/s approach running speed. Structural magnetic resonance imaging was collected on the lower extremities, from which subject-specific musculoskeletal models were developed. A one-dimensional statistical parametric mapping paired t-test was used to compare generic and subject-specific musculoskeletal models for: lower-limb kinematics, kinetics, torque matching, as well as hamstrings, adductors, and quadriceps muscle activations and fiber dynamics. Percentage change of geometric parameters between generic and subject-specific models were determined. Compared to generic models, subject-specific models showed significantly lower ankle dorsi/plantar flexion angle during sprinting and several significantly different net joint moments during sprint and cut tasks. Additionally, subject-specific models demonstrated better torque matching, more physiologically plausible fiber lengths, higher fiber velocities, lower muscle forces, and lower simulated activations in a subset of investigated muscles and motor tasks. Furthermore, subject-specific models identified between-limb differences that were not identified with generic models. Use of subject-specific modeling, even in healthy populations, may result in more physiologically plausible muscle fiber mechanics. Implementing subject-specific models may be especially beneficial when investigating populations with substantial geometric between-limb differences, or unilateral musculoskeletal pathologies, as these are not captured by a generic model.},

  abstract = {In ergonomics, strength prediction has typically been accomplished using linked-segment biomechanical models, and independent estimates of strength about each axis of the wrist, elbow and shoulder joints. It has recently been shown that multiple regression approaches, using the simple task-relevant inputs of hand location and force direction, may be a better method for predicting manual arm strength (MAS) capabilities. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) also serve as a powerful data fitting approach, but their application to occupational biomechanics and ergonomics is limited. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to perform a direct comparison between ANN and regression models, by evaluating their ability to predict MAS with identical sets of development and validation MAS data. Multi-directional MAS data were obtained from 95 healthy female participants at 36 hand locations within the reach envelope. ANN and regression models were developed using a random, but identical, sample of 85\% of the MAS data (n {$\frac{1}{4}$}456). The remaining 15\% of the data (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 80) were used to validate the two approaches. When compared to the development data, the ANN predictions had a much higher explained variance (90.2\% vs. 66.5\%) and much lower RMSD (9.3 N vs. 17.2 N), vs. the regression model. The ANN also performed better with the independent validation data (r2{$\frac{1}{4}$}78.6\%, RMSD {$\frac{1}{4}$} 15.1) compared to the regression approach (r2{$\frac{1}{4}$} 65.3\%, RMSD {$\frac{1}{4}$}18.6 N). These results suggest that ANNs provide a more accurate and robust alternative to regression approaches, and should be considered more often in biomechanics and ergonomics evaluations.},

  abstract = {Background: the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People has developed a clinical definition of sarcopenia based on low muscle mass and reduced muscle function (strength or performance). Grip strength is recommended as a good simple measure of muscle strength when `measured in standard conditions'. However, standard conditions remain to 85 be defined. 30 Methods: a literature search was conducted to review articles describing the measurement of grip strength listed in Medline, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases up to 31 December 2009. Results: there is wide variability in the choice of equipment and protocol for measuring grip strength. The Jamar hand dynamometer is the most widely used instrument with established test--retest, inter-rater and intra-rater reliability. However, 90 there is considerable variation in how it is used and studies often provide insufficient information on the protocol followed 35 making comparisons difficult. There is evidence that variation in approach can affect the values recorded. Furthermore, reported summary measures of grip strength vary widely including maximum or mean value, from one, two or three attempts, with either hand or the dominant hand alone. Conclusions: there is considerable variation in current methods of assessing grip strength which makes comparison 95 between studies difficult. A standardised method would enable more consistent measurement of grip strength and better 40 assessment of sarcopenia. Our approach is described.},

Long fingernails limit flexion of the finger joints, particularly the metacarpophalangeal joints. Lack of finger flexion will limit excursion of long flexors and extensors in patients.

  abstract = {Purpose Because of the difficulty in verifying the reliability and validity of grip strength there is still no consensus regarding its measurement, particularly short-term reliability. The present study was conducted to investigate the short-term reliability of grip strength measurement and the effects of posture and grip span. Methods One hundred healthy subjects (50 men, 50 women; mean age, 38.2 y; range, 22--58 y) were evaluated. Grip strength was measured twice as a single set by using a dynamometer and the mean value for each hand was recorded. First 3 sets of measurements were performed using 2 different approaches: (1) continuous measurement without rest and (2) interval measurement with a 1-minute rest after each set. Next 1 set of measurements was performed with 3 types of grip span: standard grip span (which was measured as one half the distance between the index finger tip and the metacarpophalangeal joint flexion crease at the base of the thumb), +10\% of the standard grip span, and -10\% of the standard grip span. Finally 1 set of measurements was performed in 3 postures: standing, sitting, and supine. Results During continuous measurement the grip strength decreased gradually as the number of sets increased. During interval measurement, however, there was no change among sets for both genders and each hand. On the basis of this result subsequent studies were performed using interval measurement. There was no significant difference in maximum grip strength between the standard and +10\% of standard grip span measurements; however, the -10\% of standard model gave the minimum grip strength in both genders. With regard to posture the minimum grip strength in both genders was obtained when the subject was supine, with no difference between standing and sitting. Conclusions Our study showed that interval measurement with a 1-minute rest after each set yielded a constant value; therefore, we advocate this approach for rapid evaluation of grip strength under different conditions. In addition the influence of grip span and posture should be considered to maximize data accuracy.},

Ten healthy young male subjects underwent a 40 h sleep-deprivation protocol under constant routine conditions. Starting at 09:00 h, subjects performed three handwriting tasks of increasing perceptual-motor complexity (writing a sentence, writing one's signature, and copying a text for 3 min) and assessed grip strength of both hands every 3 h. Handwriting performance was analyzed by writing speed, writing fluency, script size, break times, and pen pressure. The handwriting tasks revealed a coincident circadian rhythm for the frequency of handwriting as a measure of movement speed, with slowest writing speed at 03:16 h. A weak effect of task complexity was evident for the non-writing episodes: while copying a text, break times were influenced by a circadian rhythm, whereas during sentence writing, the non-writing episodes remained constant. The circadian rhythm of grip strength paralleled the time course of motivation ratings, with least motivation and weakest grip strength around 06:00 h concurrently for both hands. The rate of force production also displayed circadian rhythmicity and sharply decreased with the onset of melatonin secretion. Neither grip strength nor the kinematics of handwriting was influenced by sleep deprivation; only the level of the force rate was decreased the second day. The results show a clear circadian rhythm in the speed of handwriting and grip strength.},

Sixteen subjects participated in this study and a computerized wrist dynamometer was used for the measurement of grip strength. The independent variables were five different instructions including the Caldwell Regimen, use of verbal encouragement and visual feedback. According to the results of ANOVA, there were significant differences in main effects. Therefore, the employment of verbal encouragement or visual feedback should be noted in any paper if used while measuring static strength. Since the comparison between peak forces showed that fast contraction and immediate release upon maximal contraction instruction had greater peak forces than all other instruction sets, it can be suggested for the standard of peak force measurement that the static strength should be reached within 1.5 seconds and immediately released when reaching the maximum force and the greatest force can be designated as the peak force.},

The second part proposes the creation of a new index called ``Musculoskeletal Postural Performance Index'' (MPPI) derived from the force feasible set and its comparison with the Mechanical Efficiency Force (MEF). These comparisons were conducted at 60, 80, 100, 120 and 140\% of the Freely Chosen Frequency at submaximal and maximal conditions on 5 different phases of the push phase. The values of the MPPI were significantly correlated with those of the MEF.

The aim of our study was to verify the clinical interpretation of the proposed rotation sequence for the glenohumeral joint and to compare it with other sequences. METHODS: Fifteen glenohumeral movements in their maximal ranges were tested on five healthy subjects. The movements were separated into five groups (flexion, extension, abduction, horizontal flexion and circumduction) with three humeral rotation positions (full external, full internal and neutral). Four glenohumeral rotation sequences were constructed using YXY, YXZ, ZXY and XZY orders and angle amplitudes were examined in terms of gimbal lock and amplitude coherence. FINDINGS: The results of the gimbal lock incidence and amplitude coherence should be taken into account together. Therefore, the suitable rotation sequences for all rotation variations of abduction and extension were found and no tested rotation sequence was found to be clinically interpretable for all tested movements. INTERPRETATION: Before glenohumeral three-dimension experiments the choice of the rotation sequence should be made in agreement with the no-gimbal lock incidence and amplitude interpretability of the performed movements.},

  abstract = {Widespread use of gait or motion analysis in the diagnosis of patients with locomotor pathology and the subsequent planning and assessment of treatment has been limited because of its reliability, particularly in evaluating frontal and transverse plane components. This is because spatial reconstruction of the musculoskeletal system and calculation of its kinematics and kinetics via a skin marker-based multi-link model are subject to marker skin movement artefacts. Traditional methods treat each body segment separately without imposing joint constraints, resulting in apparent dislocations at joints predominantly because of skin movement artefacts. An optimisation method for the determination of the positions and orientations of multi-link musculoskeletal models from marker co-ordinates is presented. It is based on the minimisation of the weighted sum of squared distances between measured and model-determined marker positions. The model imposes joint constraints. Numerical experiments were performed to show that the new method is capable of eliminating joint dislocations and giving more accurate model position and orientation estimations. It is suggested that, with joint constraints and a global error compensation scheme, the effects of measurement errors on the reconstruction of the musculoskeletal system and subsequent mechanical analyses can be reduced globally. The proposed method minimises errors in axial rotation and ab/adduction at the joints and may extend the applicability of gait analysis to clinical problems.},

  abstract = {The increase in the ageing population worldwide poses a severe challenge in assisting older individuals to live independently, including the provision of mobility assistance and support in daily activities. In this paper, a practical robotic system is developed to provide intelligent support for older persons using a wheeled mobile manipulator (WMM), consisting of an omnidirectional mobile platform and a robotic arm. We focus on two critical needs: (1) mobility assistance, and (2) object manipulation support. The tasks are not executed simultaneously and each uses a task-dependent end-effector. Learning from demonstration, or kinesthetic teaching, is adopted to help the WMM to learn an elderly or disabled user's walking pattern or an able-bodied person's object manipulation skill. The robotic system can assist the user in conducting a number of daily operations. For mobility assistance, the WMM is reconfigured into a smart walker, where a novel variable admittance control is adopted to detect the user's walking intention. A learning approach based on dynamic movement primitives is implemented to capture and adapt the WMM to the user's walking pattern. For object manipulation support, a demonstrator first collaborates with an elderly user to conduct the task, and then the WMM takes the role of the demonstrator to assist the user. The Gaussian mixture model and Gaussian mixture regression are used to learn and reproduce the demonstrator's experience, respectively. The advantages and effectiveness of the proposed approach are experimentally demonstrated with a four-wheel omnidirectional WMM.},

This key improvement plays a vital role in safety considerations, which are of particular relevance to physical Human--Robot Interaction (pHRI) applications. However, currently the only proposed CEA for this purpose suffers from bulkiness, which limits its potential application in multi-degree-of-freedom manipulators. In this work, we introduce a Series Elastic Actuator with Discretely Adjustable Stiffness (SEADAS) as a novel CEA, in which the stiffness can be modulated by adding/subtracting the appropriate number of elastic elements via clutches. The novelty lies in the unique design topology, where three concentric shafts are connected in series through clutches. Each shaft is further attached to a pair of elastic elements. The number of involved spring pairs, which depends on the engagement/disengagement of the clutches, allows for the attainment of three different levels of stiffness. The realized design is significantly compact relative to the previously proposed CEA that was based on this principle. This paper details the working principle, design and development of the actuator, stiffness and dynamic modeling, as well as a gain-scheduled PID controller used for accurate, stiffness-adaptive joint position control.},

The cobot can create smooth, strong virtual surfaces and other haptic effects within a shared human/cobot workspace. The kinematic properties of cobots differ markedly from those of robots. Most significantly, cobots have only one mechanical degree of freedom, regardless of their taskspace dimensionality. The instantaneous direction of motion associated with this single degree of freedom is actively servo-controlled, or steered, within the higher dimensional taskspace. This paper explains the kinematics of cobots and the continuously variable transmissions (CVTs) that are essential to them. Powered cobots are introduced, made possible by a parallel interconnection of the CVTs. We discuss the relation of cobots to conventionally actuated robots and to nonholonomic robots. Several cobots in design, prototype, or industrial testbed settings illustrate the concepts discussed.},

However, to achieve an efficient human--robot collaboration, several challenges need to be tackled. First, a safe interaction must be guaranteed to prevent harming humans having a direct contact with the moving robot. Additionally, to take full advantage of human skills, it is important that intuitive user interfaces are properly designed, so that human operators can easily program and interact with the robot.

Then, a detailed analysis of the workspace is performed and an analytical method for the determination of the boundaries of an x-y two-dimensional subset is proposed. The new notion of dynamic workspace is defined, as its shape depends on the accelerations of the end-effector. We demonstrate that any subset of the workspace can be considered as a combination of three-cable subworkspaces, with boundaries being of two kinds: two-cable equilibrium loci and three-cable singularity loci. By using a parametric representation, we see that for the x-y workspace of a simple no-spring mechanism, the two-cable equilibrium loci represent a hyperbolic section, degenerating, in some particular cases, to one or two linear segments. Examples of such loci are presented. We use quadratic programming to choose which sections of the curves constitute the boundaries of the workspace for any particular dynamic state. A detailed example of workspace determination is included for a six-cable mechanism.},

Existing methods can be classified as either numerically or analytically based approaches. Numerical techniques exhaustively sample the task space, which can be inaccurate due to discretisation and is computationally expensive. In comparison, analytical formulations have higher accuracy, but often provides only qualitative workspace information. The proposed hybrid approach combines the high accuracy of the analytical approach and the algorithmic versatility of the numerical approach. Additionally, this is achieved with significantly lower computational costs compared to numerical methods. It is shown that the wrench-closure workspace can be reduced to a set of univariate polynomial inequalities with respect to a single variable of the end-effector motion. In this form, the workspace can then be efficiently determined and quantitatively evaluated. The proposed technique is described for a 3-DOF and a 6-DOF cable driven parallel manipulator. A detailed example in workspace determination using the proposed approach and comparison against the conventional numerical approach are presented.},

A cobot provides assistance to the human operator by setting up virtual surfaces which can be used to constrain and guide motion. While conventional servo-actuated haptic displays may be used in this way also, an important distinction is that, while haptic displays are active devices which can supply energy to the human operator, cobots are intrinsically passive. This is because cobots do not use servos to implement constraint, but instead employ ``steerable'' nonholonomic joints. As a consequence of their passivity, cobots are potentially well-suited to safety-critical tasks (e.g. surgery) or those which involve large interaction forces (e.g. automobile assembly). This paper focuses on the simplest possible cobot, which has only a single joint (a steerable wheel). Two control modes of this ``unicycle cobot'', termed ``virtual caster'' and ``virtual wall'' control, are developed in detail. Experimental results are also presented.},

Aside from providing physical contact between a robot and a person on the same production line simultaneously, the Cobot is designed as user-friendly. They enable operators to respond immediately to work done by the robot based on the company's urgent needs. This paper aims to explore the potential of Cobots in manufacturing. Cobots are widely employed in various industries such as life science, automotive, manufacturing, electronics, aerospace, packaging, plastics, and healthcare. For many of these businesses, the capacity to maintain a lucrative man-machine shared workplace can provide a considerable competitive edge. Cobots are simple to use while being dependable, safe, and precise. A literature review was carried out from the database from ScienceDirect, Scopus, Google Scholar, ResearchGate and other research platforms on the keyword ``Cobots'' or ``Collaborative robots'' for manufacturing. The Paper briefly discusses and provides the capabilities of this technology in manufacturing. Cobots are programmed to do crucial things such as handling poisonous substances, from putting screws on a vehicle body to cooking a meal, etc. Human operators can readily control this technology remotely and perform dangerous jobs. This paper's overview of Cobots and how it is differentiated from Robot is briefly described. The typical Features, Capabilities, Collaboration \& Industrial Scenarios with Cobots are also discussed briefly. Further, the study identified and discussed the significant applications of Cobots for manufacturing. Cobots are utilised in several methods and a wide range of application areas. These elevate manufacturing and other operations to new heights. They also collaborate with humans to balance the demand for safety and the need for flexibility and efficiency.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a method that allows the robot to adapt its physical behaviour to the human fatigue in human-robot co-manipulation tasks. The robot initially imitates the human to perform the collaborative task in a leader-follower setting, using a feedback about the human motor behaviour. Simultaneously, the robot obtains the skill in online manner. When a predetermined level of human fatigue is detected, the robot uses the learnt skill to take over the physically demanding aspect of the task and contributes to a significant reduction of the human effort. The human, on the other hand, controls and supervises the high-level interaction behaviour and performs the aspects that require the contribution of both agents in such a dynamic co-manipulation setup. The robot adaptation system is based on the Dynamical Movement Primitives, Locally Weighted Regression and Adaptive Frequency Oscillators. The estimation of the human motor fatigue is carried out using a proposed online model, which is based on the human muscle activity measured by the electromyography. We demonstrate the proposed method with experiments on a real-world co-manipulation task with environmental constraints and dynamic uncertainties.},

  abstract = {Robots designed to share an environment with humans, such as e.g. in domestic or entertainment applications or in cooperative material-handling tasks, must fulfill different requirements from those typically met in industry. It is often the case, for instance, that accuracy requirements are less demanding. On the other hand, concerns of paramount importance are safety and dependability of the robot system. According to such difference in requirements, it can be expected that usage of conventional industrial arms for anthropic environments will be far from optimal. An approach to increase the safety level of robot arms interacting with humans consists in the introduction of compliance at the mechanical design level. In this paper we discuss the problem of achieving good performances in accuracy and promptness with a robot manipulator under the condition that safety is guaranteed throughout whole task execution. Intuitively, while a rigid and powerful structure of the arm would favor its performance, lightweight compliant structures are more suitable for safe operation. The quantitative analysis of the resulting design trade-off between safety and performance has a strong impact on how robot mechanisms and controllers should be designed for human- interactive applications. We discuss few different possible concepts for safely actuating joints, and focus on aspects related to the implementation of the mechanics and control of this new class of robots.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we measured the maximum isometric force at the hand in eight directions in the horizontal plane and at five positions in the workplace. These endpoint forces were the result of shoulder horizontal adduction/abduction and elbow flexion/ extension torques. We found that the normalized maximum forces of all the six subjects deviated less than 15\%, despite intra-subject differences in muscle strength of more than a factor of two. The maximum forces were found to systematically depend on the force direction and on the hand position in the workspace. The largest forces were found in a direction approximately along the line connecting shoulder joint and hand, and the smallest forces perpendicular to that line, thereby forming an elliptically shaped pattern. The elongation of the pattern was the largest for those hand positions having the more extended elbow joint. By using a lumped six-muscle model, with two mono-articular muscle pairs and one bi-articular pair, we were able to predict the observed force patterns. Here, we assumed that one of the muscles generates its maximum force and the others adjust their output to point the endpoint force in the required direction. We used a principal component analysis of the surface EMGs of simultaneously measured representatives of four of the six muscles. With the same model, we were then able to determine the principal directions of all the six muscle groups.},

This method used an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the effects of hand location and force direction on MAS, and included a method to estimate the contribution of the arm's weight to the predicted strength. The AFF method predicted the MAS values very well (r2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.97, RMSD {$\frac{1}{4}$} 5.2 N, n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 456) and maintained good generalizability with external test data (r2 {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.842, RMSD {$\frac{1}{4}$} 13.1 N, n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 80). The AFF can be readily integrated within any DHM ergonomics software, and appears to be a more robust, reliable and valid method of estimating the strength capabilities of the arm, when compared to current approaches.},

  abstract = {In ergonomics, strength prediction has typically been accomplished using linked-segment biomechanical models, and independent estimates of strength about each axis of the wrist, elbow and shoulder joints. It has recently been shown that multiple regression approaches, using the simple task-relevant inputs of hand location and force direction, may be a better method for predicting manual arm strength (MAS) capabilities. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) also serve as a powerful data fitting approach, but their application to occupational biomechanics and ergonomics is limited. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to perform a direct comparison between ANN and regression models, by evaluating their ability to predict MAS with identical sets of development and validation MAS data. Multi-directional MAS data were obtained from 95 healthy female participants at 36 hand locations within the reach envelope. ANN and regression models were developed using a random, but identical, sample of 85\% of the MAS data (n {$\frac{1}{4}$}456). The remaining 15\% of the data (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 80) were used to validate the two approaches. When compared to the development data, the ANN predictions had a much higher explained variance (90.2\% vs. 66.5\%) and much lower RMSD (9.3 N vs. 17.2 N), vs. the regression model. The ANN also performed better with the independent validation data (r2{$\frac{1}{4}$}78.6\%, RMSD {$\frac{1}{4}$} 15.1) compared to the regression approach (r2{$\frac{1}{4}$} 65.3\%, RMSD {$\frac{1}{4}$}18.6 N). These results suggest that ANNs provide a more accurate and robust alternative to regression approaches, and should be considered more often in biomechanics and ergonomics evaluations.},

  abstract = {The coordination of the human musculoskeletal system is deeply influenced by its redundant structure, in both kinematic and dynamic terms. Noticing a lack of a relevant, thorough treatment in the literature, we formally address the issue in order to understand and quantify factors affecting the motor coordination. We employed well-established techniques from linear algebra and projection operators to extend the underlying kinematic and dynamic relations by modeling the redundancy effects in null space. We distinguish three types of operational spaces, namely task, joint and muscle space, which are directly associated with the physiological factors of the system. A method for consistently quantifying the redundancy on multiple levels in the entire space of feasible solutions is also presented. We evaluate the proposed muscle space projection on segmental level reflexes and the computation of the feasible muscle forces for arbitrary movements. The former proves to be a convenient representation for interfacing with segmental level models or implementing controllers for tendon driven robots, while the latter enables the identification of force variability and correlations between muscle groups, attributed to the system's redundancy. Furthermore, the usefulness of the proposed framework is demonstrated in the context of estimating the bounds of the joint reaction loads, where we show that misinterpretation of the results is possible if the null space forces are ignored. This work presents a theoretical analysis of the redundancy problem, facilitating application in a broad range of fields related to motor coordination, as it provides the groundwork for null space characterization. The proposed framework rigorously accounts for the effects of kinematic and dynamic redundancy, incorporating it directly into the underlying equations using the notion of null space projection, leading to a complete description of the system.},

  abstract = {Accurate representation of subject-specific bone anatomy in lower-limb musculoskeletal models is important for human movement analyses and simulations. Mathematical methods can reconstruct geometric bone models using incomplete imaging of bone by morphing bone model templates, but the validity of these methods has not been fully explored. The purpose of this study was to determine the minimal imaging requirements for accurate reconstruction of geometric bone models. Complete geometric pelvis and femur models of 14 healthy adults were reconstructed from magnetic resonance imaging through segmentation. From each complete bone segmentation, three sets of incomplete segmentations (set 1 being the most incomplete) were created to test the effect of imaging incompleteness on reconstruction accuracy. Geometric bone models were reconstructed from complete sets, three incomplete sets, and two motion capture-based methods. Reconstructions from (in)complete sets were generated using statistical shape modelling, followed by host-mesh and local-mesh fitting through the Musculoskeletal Atlas Project Client. Reconstructions from motion capture-based methods used positional data from skin surface markers placed atop anatomic landmarks and estimated joint centre locations as target points for statistical shape modelling and linear scaling. Accuracy was evaluated with distance error (mm) and overlapping volume similarity (\%) between complete bone segmentation and reconstructed bone models, and statistically compared using a repeated measure analysis of variance (p{$<$}0.05). Motion capture-based methods produced significantly higher distance error than reconstructions from (in)complete sets. Pelvis volume similarity reduced significantly with the level of incompleteness: complete set (92.70{\textpm}1.92\%), set 3 (85.41{\textpm}1.99\%), set 2 (81.22{\textpm}3.03\%), set 1 (62.30{\textpm}6.17\%), motion capture-based statistical shape modelling (41.18{\textpm}9.54\%), and motion capture-based linear scaling (26.80{\textpm}7.19\%). A similar trend was observed for femur volume similarity. Results indicate that imaging two relevant bone regions produces overlapping volume similarity {$>$}80\% compared to complete segmented bone models, and improve analyses and simulation over current standard practice of linear scaling musculoskeletal models.},

These muscle paths are composed of straight lines described by a limited set of fixed active via points and an optimization routine is developed to place these via points on the model in order to fit moment arms and musculotendon lengths input data. The method has been applied to a forearm musculoskeletal model extracted from the literature, using theoretical input data as an example. Results showed that for 75\% of the muscle set, the relative root-mean-square error between literature theoretical data and the results from optimized muscle path was under 29.23\% for moment arms and of 1.09\% for musculotendon lengths. These results confirm the ability of the method to automatically generate computationally efficient muscle paths for musculoskeletal simulations. Using only via points lowers computational expense compared to paths exhibiting wrapping objects. A proper balance between computational time and anatomical realism should be found to help those models being interpreted by practitioners.},
